      The site contains 5 seperate pages, home (index), gallery, coaches, schedule, contact.

    <li>Each page has a black diamond as a favicon, which is the Pressure BJJ Logo</li>
    <li>The site contains a header which is different depending on the width of the page</li>
    <li>The site contains navigation links to other pages on the nav bar or dropdown</li>
    <li>
      The site has a distinct nav bar for a small screen and larger screen. This is done with
      media queries. The nav bar changes from a dropdown to a horizontal nav bar.
    </li>
    <li>The site includes various images ranging from team pictures, logos and other events.</li>
    <li>Each page validates with the Nu Validator and WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator.</li>
    <li>The site contains 2 different font faces with backups if the first choice is not supported. These font faces
      include, "Lucida Sans", sans-serif, sans-serif, Arial, Helvetica for the body. For the header, "Gill Sans", "Gill
      Sans MT", Calibri, "Trebuchet MS"</li>
    <li>
      The site contains a form on the contact page. The user has to input their first and last
      name, email and message. The form is also neatly aligned.
    </li>
    <li>The site includes external links to instagram, facebook and Pressure BJJ's address</li>
    <li>The site is availible at <a
        href="https://ryanmillercs.github.io/p1-sp23-343/index.html">ryanmillercs.github.io</a> </li>
    <li>
      The site is availible at the github.io address provided above
    </li>
    <li>I think that overall our website is structured similarly to the sketches we originally provided. Some things on
      the sketches were not perfect, so none of the pages are exactly to scale but they have the general idea of the
      sketches. We stuck with the dark grey, white and aqua-green-blue color scheme. The color scheme works well
      together and gives the user a pleasant experience. I think the drop down menu on mobile is a good way to preserve
      screen space, but also allow the user to navigate between pages.</li>
